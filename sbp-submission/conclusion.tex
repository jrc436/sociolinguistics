\section{Conclusion}
This paper sought to add to a growing body of work about media perception of armed conflicts by systematically investigating a large sample of Reddit data and cross-referencing the Armed Conflict Database. The vast majority of discussions are negative in tone, which is logical given the somber nature of violence. Among these, comments were less likely to be disapproved of if they were from the same demographic as the majority; they were more likely to be disapproved of if they concerned a Territorial Dispute or were older. Positive sentiment comments, on the other hand, were characterized differently. While Separatism and Terrorism likely evoked inspirational messages that were widely accepted, a high number of fatalities seemed to bring out sarcastic misanthropy.
