\subsection{Reddit Corpus}
However, Twitter has a couple of drawbacks. The first is that there is no clear \textit{anchor}, or shared context, for what people are discussing. Additionally, there is no way to curate content. Reddit, a large Internet forum, also has the potential to explore users' perception and action on various issues. 

On Reddit, people start discussions by submitting either a hyperlink or text post. On many discussion Reddits, this submission is generally a link to a news article. Then, people can reply to these submissions. Users can also reply to the replies to these submissions (and so on). Additionally, users can upvote or downvote both submissions and individual comments. 

In the case of submissions, highly upvoted submissions are more likely to be seen, while highly downvoted submissions are less likely to be seen. Under an individual submission, all comment replies to that submission are sorted by score, and all replies to those comments are sorted by score, and so on. If a comment is sufficiently downvoted, it will be hidden. Hidden comments can still be replied to, upvoted, and downvoted. When a comment receives upvotes and downvotes, it is considered \textit{controversial}.  

Reddit is organized into an infinitely expandable number of smaller forums, normally referred to as subreddits. Each of these subreddits can be about any given topic, general or specific. For instance, it's possible to have a subreddit about science, biology, and genetics. These three subreddits would (or at least could) be completely independent, and they are organized in a flat rather than hierarchical fashion.

Besides the organizational ways that Reddit is different than Twitter, it also forms a subculture. The vast majority of the discussions are in English. Over half of the users are in the United States, and the majority are fairly young \cite{pewinternet}. 

Researchers normally investigate phenomena in a small selection of subreddits. For instance, Hurricane Sandy was examined with Reddit's /r/sandy subreddit to understand how types of networked gatekeeping impact the framing of a crisis situation; Reddit's voting system forms a non-traditional gatekeeper for what kind of information becomes negotiated as relevant \cite{Leavitt}. A different study examined the sharing and seeking of mental health information to examine factors that drive social support \cite{dechoudhury2014mental}.

\subsection{Armed Conflict Database}
The Armed Conflicts Database was developed by International Institute for Strategic Study, containing various indexes of armed conflicts around the world \cite{conflictDB}. They group conflicts into several regions, including Caribbean and the Americas, East Asia and Australasia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Russia and Eurasia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The Armed Conflict Database contains data on the total number of fatalities from a conflict, the year the conflict started, the current IDP, the current number of refugees, the new refugees and fatalities every year, and the IDP every year. It additionally contains a variety of factors that relate to the conflict's origin, such as ethnic violence.
