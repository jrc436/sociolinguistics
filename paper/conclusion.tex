\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we were able to perform exploratory data analysis on a large sample of data to examine how users of the Reddit Internet forum talk about armed conflicts. There seem to be many features that affect these conversations, including the location the conflict took place in, the age of the conflict, whether a foreign power was a significant antagonist in the conflict, and whether the conflict was separatist in nature. The actual externalities were not significant, which could imply that subjective views of conflicts are more important to the discussion than the objective data.
