\section{Introduction}
According to Armed Conflict Database, there are 42 active conflicts around the world causing 180,000 fatalities and more than 12 million refugees. For people who live in a relatively peaceful area, like north American, their perception, opinion and action towards these international crises are important as collectively they are influcential in shaping their countries' foreign policy \cite{Gelpi2009}. 

We are motivated to understand how people talk about and act upon armed conflicts. More specifically, we want to understand when and why people accept negative discussions and positive discussions, and what roles the features of conflicts play in the discussions. Using features like fatalities, number of refugees and Internally Displaced People (IDP), conflict intensity, region, type and duration, we hope to discover relations between them and public opinions of specific armed conflicts.
