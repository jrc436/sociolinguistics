\section{Database Description}
\subsection{Armed Conflict Database}
From the Armed Conflicts Database developed by International Institute for Strategic Study (IISS), we obtain various indexes of armed conflicts around the world. As we are interested in recent armed conflicts, we select the ones that were happening at least in one of the three years from 2012 to 2014. In total, we collected 48 conflicts covering regions including Caribbean and the Americas, East Asia and Australasia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Russia and Eurasia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In general, there are five types of conflicts from our dataset: criminal violence, ethnic conflict, separatist conflict, territorial conflict, foreign involvement and terrorism. Majority of the conflicts are inherently a combination of those types. For example, Xinjiang conflict in China is categorized as ethnic conflict, separatist conflict, and also terrorism. All the armed conflicts have relatively different life span, intensity, as well as number of casualties, refugees, and Internally Displaced People (IDP). The average years of these armed conflicts worldwide is about 23 years.
