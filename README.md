# sociolinguistics

This code was used for three publications and was used for analysis on the Reddit data set. 
It depends on the executors (https://github.com/jrc436/executors) repository. It also uses the Stanford NLP toolkit for the sentiment
analysis (see: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/). 
It is not necessarily designed for public use, but to document the methodology used in those publications. 
Please email me at jrcole@psu.edu with any questions in setup.

This paper was about producing a cognitive model of the process of word adoption. It used new words from the Reddit corpus and modelled
their activation across time. This process allows for a parameterization of some of the memory equations specified by architectures like
ACT-R.

This paper was about characterizing the communities in Reddit that are most lexically innovative. While there are several features of such
communities that could be investigated, we were interested in the relationship among communities with shared users, and so investigate
whether communities focusing on a more broad topic or a more specific one are more innovative.

This paper used keyword matching on comments to find comments that referred to ongoing and historic armed conflicts.The goal was to 
determine patterns between the characteristics of these armed conflicts and the comments that concerned them by using Reddit's curation
system and sentiment analysis.
